# vmatusevychwebsite

This is the repository for my website

package.json has library's I need: version in json format
scripts are commands i can run

npm run "start" -> "react-scripts start"
"build" -> "react-scripts build"
"test" -> "react-scripts test"
"eject" -> "react-scripts eject"

npm install searches for package.json and install any dependancies to node_modules folder
cd MyApp->go into my app
ls into my folder
npm run start -> to run

Public is used for images in my case
if press TAB will import {whatever} ->autocomplete

<a href="/About">ABOUT</a> can use this but use "Link" because adds extra things for help
